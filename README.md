# Hi there! 👋 I'm Rhi 
I’m an aspiring data scientist with the heart of a visionary and the mind of a scientist.
Currently completing a data science bootcamp, I’m building a portfolio that blends environmental science, astronomy, and research-driven exploration—fields where I believe data has the power to uncover meaning and inspire impact.


I’m learning to navigate vast datasets using Python, machine learning, data visualization, and geospatial tools, and I’m especially drawn to projects that involve climate data, satellite imagery, or astronomical research.
