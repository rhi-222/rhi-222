# 🌱 Hi there, I'm Rhi!
I’m an early-career data scientist with the heart of a visionary and the mind of a scientist.
I recently completed a data science bootcamp with TripleTen, and I’m building a portfolio that blends environmental science, geospatial data, and ethical data storytelling. I'm passionate about using data as a tool for restoration, protection, and truth-telling.

I believe deeply in treating data not just as information, but as memory and relationship.
I'm seeking entry-level or junior opportunities where I can contribute to impactful, justice-oriented projects while continuing to grow my technical and storytelling skills.
