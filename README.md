# Hi there! 👋🏼 I'm Rhi 👩🏻‍💻
I’m an aspiring data scientist with the heart of a visionary and the mind of a scientist.
Currently completing a data science bootcamp, I’m building a portfolio that blends environmental science, astronomy, and research-driven exploration—fields where I believe data has the power to uncover meaning and inspire impact.
